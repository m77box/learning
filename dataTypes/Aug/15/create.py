# #How would you test the addition of two integers in Python?


# # How can you verify that string concatenation works as expected?
# x = "python i"
# y = " awesome"
# z = x + y
# a = str("python is awesome")
# if z == a:
#     print(True)

# How do you test the behavior of multiplication between a float and an integer?
# Comparison:

# x = 13
# y = 11
# z = x * y
# if z.is_integer():
#     print("Integer")
# else:

# How can you confirm that two integers are equal?

# x = 2
# y = 3

# # How would you validate that two different types (e.g., int and float) are treated equally when they have the same value?
# # Edge Cases:
# x = 45.34
# y = 5


# How would you test division by zero in Python?
# x = 5
# y = 0

# Type Casting
# Casting Between Types:
#
# How do you convert a string to an integer in Python?
# What is the method to cast a float to an integer, and what does it return?
# How can you convert an integer to a string?
# Type Conversion Validations:
#
# How would you test the conversion of a string representing a float to a float type?
# What happens when you try to cast a non-numeric string to an integer?
# Implicit vs. Explicit Casting

# How does Python handle implicit type casting during arithmetic operations?
# How do you explicitly cast a value to a boolean and what are the rules for such casting?
# Edge Cases in Casting:
#
# How do you handle converting a very large number to a different type, such as a float to an integer?
# What is the result of casting an empty string to an integer or float?
# Casting Functions:
#
# What are the functions available in Python for casting types and how do they differ (e.g., int(), float(), str())?
# How do you validate that a list of mixed types is cast properly to a uniform type?
